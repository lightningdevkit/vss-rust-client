//!
//! VSS is an open-source project designed to offer a server-side cloud storage solution specifically
//! tailored for noncustodial Lightning supporting mobile wallets. Its primary objective is to
//! simplify the development process for Lightning wallets by providing a secure means to store
//! and manage the essential state required for Lightning Network (LN) operations.
